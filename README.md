# AI Hack Tunisia 2019 🏆💯🏅
Code Solution for machine learning problems solved in AI Hackathon of Tunisia.

# Requirments  ✅
in order to use, execute the code in the repository youi will be needing python enviroment, I prefer using anaconda with XGBoost and LightGBM models.

# Problem Solved👨‍
In this repository you will find the code solution for both Individual and Startup Track.

# Model Used 📈
In the TUnis air problem we used the LightGBM model without grid search, and in the Startup we used CNN model which called DenseNet, pretrained on the ImageNet Dataset

# Conclusion ‍💻
Doing a Machine learning Hackathon within 20 hours is just a nightmare, I learned that you need to preprocess the data and do basic feature engineering within the first hours, then fine-tuning of the final algorithm and more feature engineering will be the key aspect for your solution to win.
